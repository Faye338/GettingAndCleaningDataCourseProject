> - `Accelerometer` / `Gyroscope` indicate the sensor type  
> - `Mean` / `Std` indicate the summary calculation performed  
> - `X`, `Y`, `Z` indicate the axis of measurement

## Additional Notes

- All measurements are in **standardized units** as provided in the original UCI HAR Dataset.
- Only **mean()** and **std()** measurements are included in both datasets.
- Variables have been renamed to be descriptive and follow the `CamelCase` convention.
